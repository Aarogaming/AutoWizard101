“Thanks for the feedback. We’ll update the requested documentation only. No code/UI/policy changes. We’ll rerun final_verify.ps1 and share updated artifacts.”

## Clarification Request
“Thanks for the feedback. Could you clarify the exact doc section or artifact to adjust? We’ll make a doc-only update and rerun final_verify.ps1.”

## Deferral (Scope)
“The requested change exceeds the current offline/simulation-only scope or the gold freeze. We recommend deferring to a future research/content branch. Current submission remains unchanged.”

## Decline (Scope/Policy)
