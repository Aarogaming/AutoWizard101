# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
- Fixes land on main; backports are not guaranteed.
- UX/tooling tags (1.1.0-ux, 1.0.2-tools) follow main when security fixes apply.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- Do **NOT** open public issues for security reports.
- Preferred: use GitHub Security Advisories (Repo → Security → Report a vulnerability).
- Include (sanitized) details:
  - Summary/impact and affected component(s)
  - Repro steps or PoC (no sensitive data)
  - Observed/expected behavior and severity
  - Version/tag or commit SHA
- Checkbox reminder (reporters):
  - [ ] I did **not** include secrets or production data in logs/attachments.
