# UX Style Guide (Template)
- Framework: {{FRAMEWORK}}
- Base grid: 8px rhythm; use spacing tokens (SpaceXs/S/M/L/XL) for margins/padding.
- Typography tokens: Title/Section/Body/Caption; keep fonts consistent.
- Components: keep buttons/inputs/lists aligned to grid; avoid behavior changes.
- Accessibility: preserve tab order; ensure focus visibility and legibility at high DPI.
