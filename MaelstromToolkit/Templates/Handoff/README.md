# Handoff Module (Placeholder)
- This toolkit reserves a handoff module to integrate Codex↔ChatGPT automation (e.g., HandoffBridge) in a future phase.
- Do not copy runtime logic here; keep DevTools-only and path-filtered in CI.
- Outputs should remain under artifacts/handoff/** and be ignored by source control.
